# show correlation between genotypes and local ancestry at global eQTL loci

# first, get a list of global top SNPs (one from each eGene)

# get a list of LAVA top SNPs (one from each eGene)

# get local ancestry for each of those SNPs 

# get genotypes for each of those SNPs

# what about correlation between local ancestry and gene expression?
